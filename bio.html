            Thank you for coming to my page! So I'm Ingmar. A little about myself for those interested I'm a 23 year
            old up and coming engineer who graduated out of Hunter College in December 2020. I'm a first generation
            Albanian American (forza shqiperia) born and raised in New York. I started out my college journey with the 
            idea that I would be pursuing physical therapy since the physics of the human body and how it works really interested 
            me (and still do) but really didn't feel as engaged until I took a comp sci class and loved the material. 
            I enjoy solving problems and being able to continually learn new technology and am very proud of myself for 
            'learning how to learn' and being able to help others with their studies/life/tech as well. 
        </p>

        <p class="biography">
            As far as tech experience goes, I've worked as a discrete mathematics TA in the past, and have experience
            with a lot of different tech stacks. Almost all my foundational CS work was with C++ and my others were done 
            with different languages/frameworks including python and javascript and used React, Node JS, express, MongoDB, MySQL,
            flask. My main interests are in software engineering, AI and Machine learning, and computer architecture which is where I hope 
            to pivot to in the long term. Let me know if you have any questions!
